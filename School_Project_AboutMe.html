I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in political science. I realized that I didn't like political science as much as I thought I would. So, I decided to get into marketing because I've always been a creative person and wanted to get into design and web development.</span></span><br><br></p></tr>
    <tr>
    <div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Futura;">I started being exposed to coding when I wanted to get into marketing and learned HTML on Codeacademy. Now, at work I used HTML to build emails but it is more like edting the code in the database system. I want to advance my skills and become a front end developer where I can build a full website rather than editing HTML code.</span></spann></div><br><br></span></tr>
    <tr>
    <div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Futura;">I want to eventually start my own business and I think building a website myself would save me a lot of money and also it will help me advance my career in marketing.</span></span></div><br><br></tr>
