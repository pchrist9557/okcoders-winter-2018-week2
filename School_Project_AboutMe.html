 <div class="box"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Futura;"><b><p style="background-color:#fbf7f5: border: solid white 30px;"><br>Hello, my name is Christine and I am a Digital Marketing Coordinator at a political marketing company. I graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in political science. I realized that I didn't like political science as much as I thought I would. So, I decided to get into marketing because I've always been a creative person and wanted to get into design and web development.
I started being exposed to coding when I wanted to get into marketing and learned HTML on Codeacademy. Now, at work I used HTML to build emails, but it is more like edting the code in the database system. I want to advance my skills and become a front end developer where I can build a full website rather than editing HTML code.I want to eventually start my own business and I think building a website myself would save me a lot of money and also it will help me advance my career in marketing.<br><br>&nbsp;
When I was young, I loved art and took a lot of art classes. I got into computer art design by teaching myself but stopped when I went to college. After graduation, I picked up computer art again and started to dabble into some design work. I also started being a freelance makeup artist and would do makeup for weddings, photoshoots and other fashion events. While I was a freelance makeup artist, I also got into photography and videography and taught myself on how to take better pictures and edit videos. I am not good enough to be a photographer and videographer, but in my spare time, I like to take my camera out and take photos.
<br><br>&nbsp;
In my spare time, I like to do yoga and force myself to go to the gym. Yes, I force myself to go workout because I don't enjoy it, but I know that I have to in order to stay healthy and fit. I like to hangout and travel with my friends. We like to try different restaurants and we love alcohol, so we eat and drink every week. My favorite drink is gin and tonic. My favorite gin is Hendricks. If you are looking for a good gin, go with Hendricks because it is the best.<br><br>&nbsp;</span></span></div>
